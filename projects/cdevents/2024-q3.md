# CDEvents Update

## Features and release

The CDEvents Rust SDK was [released](https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-rust/releases/tag/cdevents-sdk-v0.1.0).
The community created a new [Implementation Working Group](https://github.com/cdevents/implementation-wg) which
focuses on the tools and architecture for adopting CDEvents and generating value.
The first use case the working group is considering is that of
[security automation](https://github.com/cdevents/implementation-wg/blob/main/docs/security_automation.md): using
events to add security features to existing CI/CD workflows without having to edit the original pipeline definitions.

## Contribution trends

After the summer break, the community is now back in full swing with active work going into
planning and implementation of the next release as well as the implementation working group.
Detailed stats are available on [LFX](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/cdf/overview/github?project=cdevents&routedFrom=Github&dateFilters=Last%20Quarter&dateRange=2024-07-01%20to%202024-09-30&compare=PP&granularity=week&hideBots=true).

## Community updates

CDEvents participated in Hacktoberfest 2024.This year we received some really good quality contributions to our docs.
We still have a many tasks that could use some love, ranging from docs to work on SDKs and more, so please keep your
contributions coming even after Hacktoberfest!
